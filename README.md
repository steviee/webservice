# My Raspberry Pi Project

This is just my private repository. I plan on creating a simple script collection to have two or more RasPis stream audio to several rooms in constant sync.
Also planned is the ability to control the playlist via Android Tablet (my Nexus 7). 

So nothing fancy, just a weekend project.

Feel free to salvage any code or scripts and comment about things. Thank you.
